            Pineapple is native to tropical and subtropical America and has been introduced elsewhere. 
            The fruit has become a characteristic ingredient in the meat, vegetable, fish, and rice dishes of what is loosely termed Pan-Asian cuisine. 
            The fruit is eaten fresh where available and in canned form worldwide
