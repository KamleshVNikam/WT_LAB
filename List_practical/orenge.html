            Oranges are round, orange-coloured fruit that grow on a tree which can reach 10 metres (33 ft) high. 
            Orange trees have dark green shiny leaves and small white flowers with five petals. 
            The flowers smell very sweet which attracts many bees. 
            An orange has a tough shiny orange skin that holds acid in outside layer.
